# Simulating the Chaotic behavior of the Chua circuit and how to control it

In this Project, we are simulating the chaotic behavior in the Chua circuit, and introducing techniques to control this chaos, and see how this affects the results.

## Note:
To run the code for the results, just run the Starchua.m for Chua chaotic behavior of Chua Circuit, and StartRealChua.m for the effect of controlling components.
